[![Anurag's github stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=ethaniccc)](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats)

I am `ethaniccc`, (pronounced e - thane - ick) a 19 year old **`idot`** who does things mostly for fun.

### Some Projects

* **__Oomph__** - An anti-cheat proxy made for Minecraft Bedrock Edition that aims to be performant as possible while having full server authority over player actions. As of April 6th, 2025, I have open-sourced the project and will be working on a different route of monetization for it. You can view the source [here](https://github.com/oomph-ac/oomph).

* **__EStatz__** - Basic recieve-only UDP server that is intended for non-essential telemetry. You can view the source code [here](https://github.com/ethaniccc/estatz)

* **__ELOG__** - A logging library made in Golang that aims to be as performant as possible while also being able to have encrypted logs on storage. Probably will use with Oomph in the near future. You can click [here](https://github.com/ethaniccc/elog) to see it's source.

* **__NoToSpanishClass__** - There are actually 2 versions of this, one in PHP and one in Javascript. The one in PHP was put up on a private website that was distributed to my friends
so we didn't have to go through the hassle of translating spanish stories our spanish teacher gave us online (the website prevented us from copy and pasting and would do somethibng weird if we tried to use inspect element).
You can click [here](https://github.com/ethaniccc/no-to-spanish-class) to check out the version in PHP, or you can click [here](https://github.com/ethaniccc/no-to-spanish-class-js) to check out the version in Javascript.
